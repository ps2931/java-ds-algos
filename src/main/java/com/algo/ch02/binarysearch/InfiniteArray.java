/*
Suppose you have a sorted array of infinite numbers, how would you search an
element in the array?

Since array is sorted, the first thing clicks into mind is binary search, but
the problem here is that we donâ€™t know size of array.

If the array is infinite, that means we donâ€™t have proper bounds to apply binary
search. So in order to find position of key, first we find bounds and then apply
binary search algorithm.

In order to find lower and upper bounds, set low to first element and high to second
element of the array. Compare target with high index element.

 - if it is greater than high index element then copy high index in low index and double the high index.
 - if it is smaller, then apply binary search on high and low indices found.
